                                            reach the venue by car or taxi.
                                            Barcelona airport is well connected with direct 
                                            flights from AerLingus, Ryanair, Vueling and lots more. 
                                            We do not recommend flying into Girona or Reus airports, 
                                            which, despite Ryanair's claims, are not near Barcelona.`;
